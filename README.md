ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning (MRI Images)
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based system to classify brain tumors using grayscale MRI images. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to identify four categories of brain conditions: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The entire workflow includes dataset preparation, model training and comparison, evaluation, visualization, and deployment as a web application using Streamlit.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Brain tumors are among the most serious medical conditions, and early diagnosis can greatly impact treatment success. Manual interpretation of MRI scans is time-consuming and subject to human error. The aim of this project is to automate the classification process using deep learning to assist medical professionals in identifying tumor types accurately and efficiently.
